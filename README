# Sturmann Project #

## Overview ##
Sturmann is a navigating system that produces voice commands while you're running your route.
Define your route on your android device using Google maps and Sturmann will calculate guiding commands for you.

## How it works##
Sturmann gets a set of coordinates representing your route and calculates the voice navigating commands with a special format.
It uses your current GPS location to determine where you are on the route and decide when to produce voice command. There is no need to look on your screen - you'll hear the command in your headphone. So you can fully concentrate on a driving while sturmann will guide you

## Usage ##
This system can be useful for (motor)bike riders, rally racers or just an ordinary drivers who would like to follow the route they don't know well.
