Sturmann is a navigating system that produces voice commands while you're running your route.
Sturmann gets a set of coordinates representing your route and calculates the voice navigating commands with a special format.
It uses your current GPS location to determine where you are on the route and decide when to produce voice command.
This system can be useful for (motor)bike riders, rally racers or just an ordinary drivers who would like to follow the route they don't know well.
