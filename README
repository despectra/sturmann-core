# Sturmann Project #

## Overview ##
Sturmann is a navigating system that produces voice commands while you're running your route.
Define your route on your android device using Google maps and Sturmann will calculate guiding commands for you.

## How it works##
Sturmann gets a set of coordinates representing your route and calculates the voice navigating commands with a special format.
It uses your current GPS location to determine where you are on the route and decide when to produce voice command.

## Usage ##
This system can be useful for (motor)bike riders, rally racers or just an ordinary drivers who would like to follow the route they don't know well.
